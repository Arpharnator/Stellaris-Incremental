 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight: "Offworld Data Mainframes"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_desc: "Advances in communication technologies allow for centralizing processes, giving birth to megaprocessing stations."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_2: "Auxiliary Data Repartition"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_2_desc: "Smaller, better hardware allows for scaling down needed space to achieve the same processing speeds."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_3: "Expansive Data Feeds"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_3_desc: "Expanding operations to be able to gather data ready for usage by specialists significantly improves scalability"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_4: "Self Hosted Communications"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_4_desc: "Retooling civilian stations to be equipped with state of the art data collection equipment, new methods to scoop up every little bit of unprocessed, raw data can prove worthwhile. Although said data will need to be processed to be used."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_5: "Superscale Data Scientists"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_5_desc: "Programs to train the average person to handle a mindnumbing scale of information greatly increases speeds at which raw data can be processed."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_6: "Mega Prospecting Corps"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_station_oversight_6_desc: "New prospecting methods and large means given to prospecting efforts render previously out of reach or unworthwhile resources to exploit available to our empire."

 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight: "Starbase Engineering Hub"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_desc: "Prototyping and theorizing about new schematics or applications of engineering in starbases is better in dedicated Zero-G environment."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_2: "Zero-G Planetary Installations"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_2_desc: "New advances in replication of Zero-G on planets allows for development of starbase engineering on planets."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_3: "Bastion Engineering Overhaul"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_3_desc: "Methods to revise starbase schematics, and engineering teams that apply promising changes allow for better structural integrity."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_4: "Bastion Simulations"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_4_desc: "The ability to simulate what would happen to a starbase would it be attacked by various weapons allows to greatly improve results and efficiency when revising starbase design."
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_5: "Advanced Bastion Simulations"
 stellaris_incremental_tech_starbase_oversight_5_desc: "Better hardware and algorithms create optimal conditions for gethering data, testing proposals, implementing them, all this while never stepping foot into a starbase."
