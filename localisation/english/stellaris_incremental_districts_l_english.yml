 district_stellaris_incremental_streamliner_starbase_prototype_parts_upgrade_usage_plural: "Starbase Prototype Assembly Districts"
 district_stellaris_incremental_streamliner_starbase_prototype_parts_upgrade_usage_desc: "Similar to its brother District where experimental parts are integrated in starbase components, with the difference that they are manufactured en masse in order to satisfy demand."

 district_stellaris_incremental_streamliner_starbase_schematics_engineer_usage: "Starbase Schematic Server District"
 district_stellaris_incremental_streamliner_starbase_schematics_engineer_usage_plural: "Starbase Schematic Server Districts"
 district_stellaris_incremental_streamliner_starbase_schematics_engineer_usage_desc: "This District is more like a giant server rather than an actually populated area, barring its outskirts. Indeed, this place is extremely hot, and scientists work in furthest possible place from the central server in order to feed it."

#SHIP
